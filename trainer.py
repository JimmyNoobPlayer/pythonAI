'''this python file is dedicated to a "trainer", a
way to train a neural net to approximate a regular
ol' python function (which could also be part of a
multi-part training regimen, or a wrapper for the
usual example-based training used in most simple
online neural net examples.

The most important quality of the function is the
number of values in the vectors for input and output,
these numbers must match between the neural net being
trained, the trainer, and the function to be approximated.

The trainer will usually need a "translator" to translate inputs into the numpy column vector input, and translate the output of the net into 

The expected format of the training example points is
(vect, output) where vect is a numpy column vector
representing the input point, and output a numpy column
vector representing the output of the neural net.

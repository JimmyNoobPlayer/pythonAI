complete the Design Doc and determine exactly the responsibilities of the neuralnet, trainer, and visualizer modules.

create the subclass of List to use in the whole package.

figure out the logic error in the SGD visualizer (the graph should be a smooth descending curve showing the error decreasing gradually, but it's a jagged noisy curve that doesn't show any decrease. This could be due to an error in the neural net code itself, an error in the visualizer, or even a problem with choosing meta variables in the SGD process.

from the Design Doc create unit tests.
